Are there any good free GPT-powered AI summarizer for very long text?
Question
I'm looking for something that can summarize very long texts (like a full-size novel or a college research paper) then use chatGPT or something similar to analyze, summarize, or ask questions about it.

I could use chatGPT's API to build a program to do that (like this one posted here a month ago), but over time it gets very costly. Are there any free programs out there that do just that?

There are a lot of open source tools for summarizing/comparing/chatting with lengthy documents. Most of them use something like pinecone to store embeddings from your document(s), although some let you store embeddings locally (e.g. BriefGPT). I've tried some of them with medium sized docs (~20 pages), and found them to work pretty well. Not sure whether the performance drops off as you move into full sized novel length docs though. Might be good to test some of them on a book you're very familiar with before trusting them to accurately summarize unknown materials for you.

Here are some links to the gpt-document tools I have bookmarked. Some of them do have online demos, but you'll typically have more flexibility if you implement them on your local machine.

I've actually found a pretty neat tool that has to be added to this list: https://www.notsly.com/

Can summarize large texts in multiple languages, and also give you the option to generate long summary, short summary or Key Insights from it.

The cherry on top is the calendar integration feature, where you can generate key tasks from your notes/texts and integrate them into your calendar.

Hey would add one more to this list: summarize-article.co

Can summarize articles up to 300+ pages and condenses down to 5-10 pages. A lot of these have context length restrictions, but this one seems to work on very long text, and also outputs short/medium/long summaries to a Word doc which is very helpful

Hey there! An AI API Key is needed to run Notsly well. You can get one from Ai.Google.Dev or from OpenAI.
If you navigate to the API Key section, you can see the complete tutorial over there. Let me DM you the tutorial as well :)

I've tried a lot of tools and a lot of them were underwhelming, either in terms of features or the interface. But this new product checks all the boxes: https://www.notsly.com/

There is a single lifetime purchase and you get to bring your own key.

In terms of features, you get to generate long, short summaries and also derive key insights. On top of this, it generates actional tasks out of my notes and integrates them into my calendar.

Easy to use to be honest

I personally use NLP Cloud's summarization API because they propose cheap models for summarization that are not charged per token. These models don't natively support very large inputs but they actually propose a smart "asynchronous mode" that allows you to send very large documents (up to 1 million tokens): under the hood they actually split your document and made many summarization requests in parallel.

Managers need to take into account the country conditions that may have a significant impact on their success when making decisions. Typically, these circumstances generally present opportunities. Describe in depth the opportunities that Walmart encountered upon entering South Africa in 2011.
Unrealized Potential: South Africa provided Walmart with a retail market that had not been fully utilized, giving a lot of opportunities for expansion. During that period, Walmart was drawn to the country for its expanding middle class and increasing consumer purchasing ability.
Positive demographic trends: The youthful, urban population and rising disposable incomes in South Africa matched Walmart's desired customer demographic. This change in population demographics gave Walmart the chance to gain a solid presence and secure a large portion of the nation's consumer market.

Regulatory Incentives: The South African government was promoting foreign direct investment by providing multinational corporations such as Walmart with different incentives and tax advantages. The advantageous regulatory conditions allowed Walmart to create a suitable environment for its operations.

I'm using AXN Ai Tool to summarize long texts Although It's not free, but it's really good, It can:

Shorten long texts into shorter, meaningful summaries

Find key points and important information

Detect mistakes and inconsistencies

Create new content based on the original text

I think it's worth checking out, It's easy to use and does a great job.

Be careful. These tools arnt actually summarising the long text. Chatgpt can never go over it's token limit. What they are doing is searching through the text to get maybe the top 5 chunks of text that are relevant to your question and passing that to chatgpt and then asking chatgpt to summarise that.

It can sometimes produce summaries of book that look amazing. But it hasn't actually read the whole book so you want to be careful of this depending on your application

Incorrect. Review the Code Interperer. If you feed a certain word-count text as plain message, youâ€™ll hit a wall. If you feed it as a file, like pdf or docs in CI, it will deal with at least ~350k words as well as. Min. ~1000 pages. See proof here:

12th example: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&feature=youtu.be

I think they found a way to get past this issue here in this tool: summarize-article.co. It uses recursive summarization to generate an outline, and then uses the outline to re-generate the text summary which helps preserve the longer winodw

This is a lossy method, I never preferred it.
There is a new paper with a new methodology researchers named MemGPT, and characterized it as an LLM operating system. The agent is provided function call instructions to archive the original messages for its future retrieval, as well as effectively indexing memories, and drawing inferential bits of information. It's an excessively costly set up, as multiple processing of the same prompt is required and the longer the chat is this effect compounds, but so far the least lossy method is MemGPT.

Here is the paper on this:

https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560

And the website:

https://memgpt.ai

For the lazier (like me) a YouTube video summary on the matter:

Exactly. The embeddings technique is useful, but it's a hack, so it can't give you holistic answers. Embed an entire book and ask GPT to summarize the main character's story arc. It can't do it. It can only answer narrow questions about episodic events in the book.

Are there any fixes to this?
I was wondering how such models could be trained to learn everything fed to them and come up with answers as a holistic interpretation of what they were fed.
Not just a novel, but let's say an entire library, or all scientific articles.

There's no "fix" because it's a structural limitation. There are "recursive" summarizers that help a little, but nothing that will beat a larger context window's ability to really follow a thread through thousands of tokens.
